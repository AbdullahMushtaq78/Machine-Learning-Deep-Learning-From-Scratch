# Naive Bayes Classification
- **This is a completely generic implementation of Naive Bayes Classification with the support for more than one classes.**
## The Notebook has all of the code along with the lots of comments to understand the working of the algorithm. 
- Naive Bayes is a non-learning model, in this model, probabilities are calculated for input taken from the user or from the dataset.
- In this implementation, input is saved in a separate list containing the valid input according to the dataset. But these can be changed depending upon the dataset or input taken from the user.
- Tennis.csv is the dataet file from where the data is collected to calculate the probabilities.
  -Sample values form the data:
