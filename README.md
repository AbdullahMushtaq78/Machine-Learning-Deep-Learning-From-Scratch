# Machine Learning / Deep Learning From Scratch in Python
This Repository contains the implementation of the foundational Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms, written from scratch using Numpy and Pandas.
Along with some standard algorithms and models using famous libraries like Scikit and TensorFlow.
I wrote Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks while self-studying, and I took some courses on machine learning and deep Learning to get hands-on technical expertise during my second year as a Sophomore (2021).

## Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classification
- KNN Classifier
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- K-Mean Clustering

And of course, there are a lot of different algorithms that I implemented and learned but got lost or never made it to this repository. :(

The Neural Networks algorithm in this repository is a very basic implementation. Since neural networks themselves require a lot of details to understand (like Gradient Descent), I have created another repository with a complete implementation of neural networks from scratch using only Numpy. Please check out this [repository](https://github.com/AbdullahMushtaq78/Neural-Networks-Library-from-scratch-) for a detailed implementation.


Keep Learning!
